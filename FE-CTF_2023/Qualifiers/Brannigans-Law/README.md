# Brannigan's Law

## Description
*Captain Zip Brannigan at your service!

Stardate... April. The 13th. Point two.

We've made it to Kompromaise 7, the have-it-both-ways world.

Everyone here, from young to old, and in between (..especially in between) are used to compromising.

It. Disgusts. Me.

But fear not! I have assigned my most trusted chump^H^H^H^H^Hdiplomatic envoy to help make contact.

That's YOU!

You need to send a zip file to initiate first contact.

Now remember, the younger seyvaan-siip people, and the older, more conservative ohns-ehp people don't get along.

Please send a single file that makes everybody happy. And no excuses!

What are you waiting for, cadet? Fly over to brannigans-law.hack.fe-ctf.dk:1337 right away.

Brannigan out!*
